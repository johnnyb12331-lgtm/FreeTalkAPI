## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps Summary

Once you have the checklist complete, follow these steps:

1. **Create DigitalOcean Droplet** (Ubuntu 22.04)
2. **Point domain to droplet IP** (update DNS A records)
3. **SSH into server** and do initial setup
4. **Install required software** (Node.js, MongoDB, PM2, Nginx)
5. **Upload your code** (Git clone or SCP)
6. **Configure .env** file on server
7. **Obtain SSL certificate** (Let's Encrypt)
8. **Configure Nginx** as reverse proxy
9. **Start app with PM2**
10. **Test everything**

Full detailed instructions: See `DIGITALOCEAN_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Commands Reference

### On Your Local Machine:
```bash
# Test your app locally first
npm install
npm start

# Check for any errors
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### On DigitalOcean Server:
```bash
# SSH into server
ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP

# Check app status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs freetalk-api

# Restart app
pm2 restart freetalk-api
```

## ðŸ”— Important URLs After Deployment

- API Base: `https://freetalk.site`
- Health Check: `https://freetalk.site/health`
- API Endpoints: `https://freetalk.site/api/...`

---

## ðŸ“ž What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check PM2 logs:** `pm2 logs freetalk-api`
2. **Check Nginx logs:** `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`
3. **Check MongoDB:** `sudo systemctl status mongod`
4. **Test locally first:** Always test changes locally before deploying
5. **Refer to troubleshooting section** in `docs/DIGITALOCEAN_DEPLOYMENT.md`
